The Salt API system is used to expose the fundamental aspects of Salt control
to external sources. salt-api acts as the bridge between Salt itself and
REST, Websockets, etc.

NOTE: this software is still pre-alpha, expect interfaces to change (frequently).

The in-progress documentation is available on Read the Docs:
