##### Primary configuration settings #####
##########################################
# The address of the interface to bind to
#interface: 0.0.0.0

# The port used by the publisher
#publish_port: 4505

# The number of worker threads to start, these threads are used to manage
# return calls made from minions to the master, if the master seems to be
# running slowly, increase the number of threads
#worker_threads: 5

# The port used by the communication interface
#ret_port: 4506

# Directory used to store public key data
#pki_dir: /etc/salt/pki

# Directory to store job and cache data
#cachedir: /var/cache/salt

# Set the number of hours to keep old job information
#keep_jobs: 24


#####        Security settings       #####
##########################################
# Enable "open mode", this mode still maintains encryption, but turns off
# authentication, this is only intended for highly secure environments or for
# the situation where your keys end up in a bad state. If you run in open more
# you do so at your own risk!
#open_mode: False

# Enable auto_accept, this setting will automatically accept all incoming
# public keys from the minions
#auto_accept: False


#####         Cluster settings       #####
##########################################
# Salt supports automatic clustering, salt creates a single ip address which
# is shared among the individual salt components using ucarp. The private key
# and all of the minion keys are maintained across the defined cluster masters
# The failover service is automatically managed via thse settings

# List the identifiers for the other cluster masters in this manner:
# [saltmaster-01.foo.com,saltmaster-02.foo.com,saltmaster-03.foo.com]
# The members of this master array must be running as salt minions to
# facilitate the distribution of cluster information
#cluster_masters: []

# The cluster modes are "parinoid" and "full"
# parinoid will only distribute the signed minion public keys
# full will also distribute the master private key and turn on the ucarp
# managed interface, if full is selected ensure that cluster_interface and
# cluster_addr values are set, otherwise the full cluster will fail to start
# the ucarp interface
#cluster_mode: parinoid

# The network interface to bind the ucarp shared ip address to
#cluster_interface: eth0

# The network address used by ucarp, this is the adress that the minions
# should be referencing as the master
#cluster_addr: 


#####         Logging settings       #####
##########################################
# The location of the master log file
#log_file: /var/log/salt/master
# The level of messages to send to the log file
